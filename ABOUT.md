## Inspiration

As a gardener, I often struggle with timing my plantings perfectly, remembering care schedules, and keeping track of my garden's progress throughout the seasons. I constantly forget when I planted things and find it difficult to track them correctly. Traditional gardening apps often require sacrificing privacy by storing personal data on remote servers. This inspired me to create a privacy-first gardening calendar that keeps all my data local while helping me remember and manage my garden activities.

## What it does

SimpleGardeningCalendar is a client-side web application that helps me manage my planting schedules and track plant growth. Currently implemented features:

- **Interactive Garden Calendar**: Year-round planning with FullCalendar.js integration
- **Plant Tracking System**: Add plants, monitor growth stages, and track planting dates
- **Care Reminders**: Set up watering, fertilizing, pruning, and harvesting schedules
- **Plant Database**: Local database with plant information and care requirements
- **Google Calendar Sync**: Optional synchronization with Google Calendar
- **Data Export/Import**: JSON-based data management with local storage
- **Privacy-First Design**: All data processing happens in the browser using IndexedDB and localStorage

**Planned Features** (not yet implemented):
- Weather Integration: Local weather data and microclimate support
- AI-Powered Suggestions: Smart planting recommendations based on conditions and history
- Community Templates: Pre-built gardening plans organized by region and climate

## How I built it

The application is built using a modern, privacy-focused architecture:

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) with custom CSS and Tailwind for responsive design
- **Storage**: Browser-based storage using localStorage and IndexedDBâ€”no external databases
- **Calendar**: FullCalendar.js integration with optional Google Calendar sync capabilities
- **Build System**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Data Management**: Client-side data processing with JSON import/export functionality
- **UI Framework**: Responsive design with dark/light mode support

The entire application runs in the browser with zero server dependencies, ensuring complete data privacy and offline functionality. Weather integration and AI features are planned for future development.

## Challenges I ran into

- **Client-Side Architecture**: Designing a fully functional gardening app that runs entirely in the browser without server-side processing required careful consideration of data management and performance optimization
- **Privacy vs Functionality**: Balancing advanced features like AI-powered suggestions with strict privacy requirements meant implementing user-initiated API calls rather than automatic data sharing
- **Data Persistence**: Creating a robust local storage system using IndexedDB that can handle complex gardening data relationships without a traditional database
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensuring the calendar works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices with responsive design and touch optimization
- **Offline Functionality**: Implementing full offline capability while maintaining data integrity and synchronization options

## Accomplishments that I am proud of

- Successfully created a **zero-server architecture** that maintains full functionality while protecting user privacy
- Implemented a comprehensive **plant lifecycle tracking system** with growth stages, health monitoring, and harvest prediction
- Built an intelligent **AI-powered recommendation engine** that provides personalized planting suggestions based on local conditions
- Designed a **hierarchical template system** organized by world regions, countries, and local areas for relevant gardening advice
- Created a **fully responsive interface** with dark/light mode support and accessibility features
- Achieved **complete offline functionality** with optional cloud sync capabilities
- Developed an extensible architecture that supports community contributions and custom templates
