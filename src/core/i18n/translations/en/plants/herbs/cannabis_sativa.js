    fertilizing: "High nitrogen in veg (3-1-2), high phosphorus in flower (1-3-2).",
    sunlight: "18/6 hours in vegetative, 12/12 hours in flowering.",
    spacing: "3-6 feet apart, can grow very tall.",
    support: "Strong stakes or SCROG for height management.",
    humidity: "65-70% seedling, 40-50% vegetative, 40-45% flowering.",
    temperature: "70-85째F day, 65-80째F night.",

  commonProblems: {
    "Height Management": "Can grow very tall - use LST, topping, or SCROG",
    "Long Flowering": "Extended harvest time - be patient, monitor trichomes",
    "Nutrient Deficiency": "Large plants need more nutrients - increase feeding",
    "Light Penetration": "Dense canopy - defoliate and LST for light penetration",
  },
