# Gardening Calendar – Technical Architecture (Client-Side Only, Zero-Server)

## 1. Overview
Gardening Calendar is a privacy-first, client-side web application for gardeners to manage planting schedules, track activities, and receive AI-powered advice. All logic and data processing occur in the browser—no server-side storage, processing, or user data leaves the device.

---

## 2. Core Principles

- **Client-Side Only:** All computation, storage, and processing in-browser (no backend, no server APIs, no external persistence).
- **Zero Database Architecture:** Uses browser storage (localStorage, IndexedDB) for all persistence; no external DBs.
- **Privacy & Security:** All sensitive data remains local. Optional image uploads for plant identification are processed in-browser or via user-authorized APIs. Minimal attack surface.
- **Minimal Dependencies:** No heavy frameworks; vanilla JS (ES6+), custom CSS, and only essential libraries for AI, calendar, or image processing.

---

## 3. Technical Stack

- **Core:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), Custom CSS
- **Storage:** localStorage, IndexedDB
- **AI Integration:** LLM API (user-initiated, privacy-respecting), client-side ML for plant ID/health (optional, offline)
- **Calendar:** Google Calendar API (OAuth 2.0, minimal scope), ICS export/import
- **Location/Weather:** Local weather API, climate zone detection, growing season calculations
- **UI:** See [UI/UX Design Principles](#uiux-design-principles) for detailed requirements.

---

## 3a. UI/UX Design Principles

- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive for all device sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Dark/Light Mode:** User-selectable dark and light themes; automatic system preference detection.
- **Eye Comfort:** High-contrast color schemes, reduced blue light options, adjustable font sizes, and spacing for readability.
- **Accessibility:** WCAG-compliant, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, focus management, and color-blind friendly palettes.
- **Preview Features:** Real-time previews for calendar events, garden layouts, and plant lifecycle visualizations.
- **Customization:** User-configurable UI settings (theme, font size, layout density).
- **Touch & Mouse Optimized:** Large touch targets, gesture support, and mouse/keyboard usability.
- **Modern Aesthetics:** Clean, minimal, and distraction-free interface with comfort-focused design.
- **Feedback & Animation:** Subtle transitions, loading indicators, and clear feedback for user actions.

---

## 4. Key Components

- **Image Processing:** Client-side image handling, optimization, optional plant ID via LLM or local ML (requires user-initiated authentication, e.g., OpenAI Auth, Google Auth, or API key; all API calls are made directly from the browser to the external service—never via an app-owned server), secure sandboxing
- **Calendar Integration:** Google Calendar sync (OAuth 2.0), ICS export/import, event management, reminders
- **Data Processing:** Local transformation, schedule management, weather integration, lifecycle tracking, bloom/harvest prediction
- **UI Components:** Interactive planning, real-time preview, plant database integration, year-round calendar, lifecycle visualization, location-based planning
- **Plant Tracking:** Growth/bloom/harvest tracking, health indicators, care reminders, multi-location support

---

## 5. Performance & Resource Optimization

- **Efficient Data Handling:** Local storage, optimized image/calendar ops, minimal memory footprint, caching
- **Resource Management:** Memory/storage optimization, lazy loading, background processing, data chunking, progressive enhancement
- **Offline Capability:** Full functionality offline, with manual/optional sync for cloud or calendar integration
- **Performance Monitoring:** Load/memory/storage usage tracking, optimization tools

---

## 6. Security Features

- **Data Privacy:** All data processed locally; optional image uploads are user-initiated and privacy-respecting
- **Authentication:** Google OAuth 2.0 for calendar only; no password storage; secure token handling
- **Image Handling:** Secure sandboxing, privacy-focused design, no external persistence without user action

---

## 7. Integration Capabilities

- **Calendar:** Google Calendar (OAuth 2.0), ICS (iCalendar) export/import, event/reminder sync
- **Weather:** Local weather APIs (OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, etc.), microclimate support, forecast/historical data
- **Plant Database:** Pre-packaged, updatable plant/care/disease/pest/treatment data; optional user-initiated API fetches
- **AI/ML:** LLM API for advice/ID (user-initiated), client-side ML for offline plant/disease recognition
- **Mapping:** Optional map overlays (Google Maps, OSM, Mapbox) for garden layout, sun tracking, zone mapping
- **Cloud Storage (Optional):** User-initiated sync/backups (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.), encrypted, never automatic
- **Social/Community (Optional):** Local sharing, export, QR code, no server-side social features
- **Smart Home (Optional):** Local device integration via browser APIs (e.g., Bluetooth soil sensors, local weather stations); no cloud relay—direct browser-to-device communication

---

## 8. Plant & Care Database

- **Structure:** IndexedDB/localStorage, hierarchical, efficient indexing, versioned updates
- **Plant Profiles:** Basic info, growth data, care requirements, climate data, lifecycle tracking
- **Disease/Pest/Treatment:** Symptoms, prevention, treatment, recovery, organic/chemical options
- **Data Sources:** Pre-packaged bundles (RHS, USDA, PlantNet, etc.), user-initiated updates, no automatic external sync
- **Documentation:** Local care guides, best practices, problem-solving, seasonal/maintenance templates

---

## 9. Client-Side Data Management

- **Local-First:** All data stored in-browser; optional, user-triggered cloud sync/export/import
- **Data Organization:** Hierarchical, indexed, quick search, related data linking
- **Data Portability:** Export/import, backup/restore, version control, privacy controls, clear data options
- **Offline Support:** Full offline access, background sync, conflict resolution, data integrity

---

## 10. Gardening Features & Templates

- **Lifecycle Management:** Growth stage, health, bloom, harvest, dormancy tracking
- **Soil/Water Management:** Soil analysis, improvement, irrigation, moisture monitoring, conservation
- **Pest/Disease Control:** Prevention, detection, treatment, tracking, companion planting
- **Harvest/Post-Harvest:** Planning, yield prediction, storage, preservation, composting
- **Presets/Templates:** Garden types, climate-specific, plant combinations, crop rotation, seasonal/maintenance routines
- **Community Templates (Local Only):** Pre-built garden plans for different climates, garden types, or goals provided as JavaScript presets; core presets are organized hierarchically by world region (e.g., Europe, North America, Southeast Asia), country (e.g., Germany), state/region (e.g., Bayern), ZIP code, and city; users can save and share templates as files (no server or cloud required) and extend with their own
- **Smart Planting Suggestions:** AI-powered recommendations for what to plant and when, based on local weather, climate zone, and user history; includes succession and companion planting suggestions
- **Symptom Checker & Visual Guides:** Client-side symptom checker with visual guides for disease/pest detection; integrates with local image analysis and optional cloud AI
